	// Where are they scope:var are function scope, available only inside the function (local) or the window/global

	//REPLACING THE IIFE:
		//ejemplos regular:
	(function(){
		var myText = "hello stupid world 🌎";
		console.log(myText)
	})();

	//ejemplo es6:
	{
		const myTeacher = "Wes Bos 💛"
		console.log(myTeacher)
	}

	//FOR LOOP
	//regular problem in the below case is that the iteration has already run and i is get after the loop has finished

	/*for(var i = 0;i<=10;i++){
		console.log(i)
		setTimeout(function(){
			console.log("the number is:" + i)
		},1000)
	}*/

			setTimeout(function(){

			},1000)
		};

	//the temp dead zone
	console.log("follow Mathias Bynens.  This dude knows his shit..I mean JS 🐮")
